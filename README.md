# Neural Network Charity Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this analysis we:
- Preprocessed the data for a neural network model
- Compiled, trained, and evaluated the model
- Optimized the model

This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
